# Loal_Recommendation_model
A loan recommendation model analyzes user data like income, CIBIL score, age, and loan needs to suggest suitable bank offers. It filters options based on eligibility and recommends the best loan using criteria such as lowest interest rate, EMI, and maximum loan amount.

📊 Loan Eligibility Prediction System
💼 Project Overview
A Loan Recommendation Model is a machine learning-based system designed to analyze a user’s financial profile and suggest the most suitable loan offers from various banks. It begins by checking whether the applicant is eligible for a loan using input data such as income, CIBIL score, age, employment type, and loan preferences.

If the applicant meets the eligibility criteria, the model then filters available loan offers and recommends the best option based on factors like:

✅ Lowest interest rate
✅ Minimum EMI
✅ Highest approved loan amount
✅ Shortest/most preferred loan term

This system aims to automate and simplify the loan selection process for users and reduce the manual workload for banks and financial institutions. It helps applicants understand their financial standing, improves transparency in loan selection, and enhances the speed and accuracy of loan processing.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivani26069/Loan_Recommendation_model.git
cd Loan_Recommendation_model
```
### Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Make sure Python is installed. Then, run:
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib

###Step 3: Train the Machine Learning Model
python train_model.py

###Step 4: Run the Main Program
You can now run the loan recommendation system using:
python black.py

This will:
Ask for user input like income, age, loan amount, etc.
Check eligibility using the trained model.
If eligible, recommend the best loan offer from banks_loan_offers.csv.


🚀 Future Enhancements
🔐 User Login System
Implement a secure login and registration system so users can create accounts and log in to view their loan application history.

This would allow personalized experiences and make the platform more user-centric.

🤖 Conversational AI Assistant
Integrate a smart chatbot using technologies like OpenAI, Dialogflow, or Rasa.

The assistant can guide users through the loan eligibility check, explain why a loan was rejected, and answer basic queries about documentation, EMI, etc.

🆔 Aadhaar-Based Auto-Fill
Add functionality to auto-fetch user details using their Aadhaar number via a secure API (or simulated data).

This would reduce manual input, improve accuracy, and make the system feel smarter and more real-world ready.
