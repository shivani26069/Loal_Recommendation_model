A Loan Recommendation Model analyzes user data like income, CIBIL score, age, and loan needs to suggest suitable bank offers. It filters options based on eligibility and recommends the best loan using criteria such as lowest interest rate, EMI, and maximum loan amount.

💼 Project Overview
A Loan Recommendation Model is a machine learning-based system designed to analyze a user’s financial profile and suggest the most suitable loan offers from various banks. It begins by checking whether the applicant is eligible for a loan using input data such as:

Income
CIBIL score
Age
Employment type
Loan preferences

If the applicant meets the eligibility criteria, the model then filters available loan offers and recommends the best option based on factors like:

✅ Lowest interest rate
✅ Minimum EMI
✅ Highest approved loan amount
✅ Shortest/most preferred loan term

This system aims to automate and simplify the loan selection process for users and reduce the manual workload for banks and financial institutions. It helps applicants understand their financial standing, improves transparency in loan selection, and enhances the speed and accuracy of loan processing.
